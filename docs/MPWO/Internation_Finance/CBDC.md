# Central Bank Digital Currency

## Approach and timeline for introduction of CBDCs in International Banking

### Approach

Preparations will be made quietly, and it will be introduced as a "quick fix" to a "problem" cropping up. Black Swan event?

#### Pre-requisites

- Framework preparation by Central Banks - Likely being done quietly in collaboration
- Testing out international settlements - Done by SWIFT, Brussels, see Source
- Evaluation of value of all assets and debts in digital tokens - Not an absolute pre-requisite for introducing the system.

### Timeline

- Evaluation of value of all assets and debts in digital tokens - TBD by 2030?

### Why?

- Complete knowledge of each transaction:
  - parties involved
  - goods/services being exchanged
  - digital currency amount involved
  - timestamp
- Knowledge gained could be used in various ways:
  - Rationing of certain goods/services
  - Social engineering via:
    - Encouraging/discouraging certain actions/behaviors in the populace
    - Excluding/including certain groups from certain goods/services
    - Has the potential to be granular enough to change the system's behavior towards specific individuals in deliberate fashion
  - Profiling all individuals of the populace
