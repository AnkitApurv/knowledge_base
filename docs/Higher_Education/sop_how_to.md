Do’s & Don’ts

    Do not make your SOP read like a CV – Don’t repeat what you have mentioned in CV. SOP should include important lessons learnt from past studies/work ex.
    Don’t exceed more than 750-800 words ideally.
    No need to use advanced vocabulary- this is not an essay competition. However, your motivation to study must be highlighted.
